Hey, I'm Brian!

I'm currently in college pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Political Science. So far, the former has popped up a bit more in my github (who would have guessed?).

I'm entirely self-taught in Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS and frameworks (Django, React, etc), and have taken classes using, Java, Racket, and C++. Due to my mostly self-taught nature, a lot of my projects are not as polished as they would be if I intended them to represent myself, since they're just being fun projects I've thought of over the years. Although, being a student, I'm hoping to gain experience and learn best practices from more experienced coders, so if you happen to have an open internship...

I enjoy programming, but I my real passions are solving puzzles and making my life easier, both of which I can do when programing. As a ressult of this, most of my projects spawn from a minor annoyance, which I then spend more time programming something to do it instead of me just doing it myself. A while back I got into webscrapping and automation with Beautiful Soup and Selenium respectively, which are really useful for enabling laziness, but I've dabbled in a variety of languages and projects. Most of my recent coding has been for work, which is hidden away in private repos, or for school which isn't really interesting enough to upload here. 

If you're interested in contacting me, for (constructive) critism on my commenting practices or to offer me a job copy-pasting from Stack Overflow, you can reach me at [briandalegoodell@gmail.com](mailto:briandalegoodell@gmail.com?subject=We%20Are%20Impressed%20By%20Your%20Githhub%20and%20Want%20To%20Pay%20You%20Exorbitantly )
