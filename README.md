Hey, I'm Brian!

I'm currently in college pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Political Science. So far, the former has popped up a bit more in my github (who would have guessed?).

I'm entirely self-taught in Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS and frameworks (Django, React, etc), and have taken classes using, Java, Racket, and C++. Due to my mostly self-taught nature, a lot of my projects are not as polished as they would be if I intended them to represent myself, since they're just being fun projects I've thought of over the years. Although, being a student, I'm hoping to gain experience and learn best practices from more experienced coders, so if you happen to have an open internship...

I do really have a passion for programming (and just making my life easier) so all of my projects spawn from something in my life inspiring me to waste way more time programming something to do a task instead of me just doing it. I've found particular success in ading my idleness with webscrapping and automation with Beautiful Soup and Selenium respectively, so they crop up in a few of my projects, but I've dabbled in a pretty varied subset of CS, a lot of which didn't form into projects that could be displayed here. 

If you're interested in contacting me, for (constructive) critism on my commenting practices or to offer me a job copy-pasting from Stack Overflow, you can reach me at [briandalegoodell@gmail.com](mailto:briandalegoodell@gmail.com?subject=We%20Are%20Impressed%20By%20Your%20Githhub%20and%20Want%20To%20Pay%20You%20Exorbitantly )
