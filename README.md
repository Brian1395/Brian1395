Hey, I'm Brian!

I'm currently in college pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Political Science. This github is geared more towards the former, with a pseudo-random selection of my projects from over the years, but if you want to discuss anything political, you're welcome to come to Thanksgiving Dinner.

I'm entirely self-taught in Python, Javascript, and Java, and have taken classes using Racket and C++. Due to my mostly self-taught nature, a lot of my projects are not as polished as they would be if I had learned in a formal environment, but they get the job done. I'm hoping to find gain experience and learn best practices from more experienced coders, so if you happen to have an open internship...

I do really have a passion for programming (and just making my life easier) so all of my projects spawn from something in my life inspiring me to grab a keyboard and whittle away the rest of my free time for a week. I particularly like webscrapping and automation with Beautiful Soup and Selenium respectively, so they crop up in a few of my projects. 

If you're interested in contacting me, be it to yell at me for not commenting enough or to offer me a job copy-pasting from Stack Overflow, you can reach me at [briandalegoodell@gmail.com](mailto:briandalegoodell@gmail.com?subject=We%20Are%20Impressed%20By%20Your%20Githhub%20and%20Want%20To%20Pay%20You%20Exorbitantly)
